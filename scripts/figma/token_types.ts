/**
 * Defines what we expect a Design Tokens file to look like in the codebase.
 *
 * This format mostly adheres to the [draft W3C spec for Design Tokens](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/)
 * as of its most recent 24 July 2023 revision except for the $type property, for which
 * we allow `string` and `boolean` values in addition to the spec's `color` and `number` values.
 * We need to support `string` and `boolean` types to align with the resolved types for Figma variables.
 *
 * Additionally, we expect each tokens file to define tokens for a single variable collection and mode.
 * There currently isn't a way to represent modes or themes in the W3C community group design token specification.
 * Once the spec resolves how it wants to treat/handle modes, this code will be updated to reflect the new standard.
 *
 * Follow this discussion for updates: https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/issues/210
